Here're the goal-oriented breakdown for User Growth, Retention, and Behavior Analysis topics, providing intructions to help you choose the right statistical models and visualization methods:

1. User Growth Analysis

Objective: Analyze user acquisition, channel performance, and growth trends to optimize acquisition strategies.

Use Cases:
	- Present user growth trend over time: linear chart.
    - Predict user growth trends: linear regression.
	- Analyze conversion rates from new to leave: funnel chart.
    - Visualize user demographics based on location, device, and channels: distribution heatmap.
    - Compare conversion rates across different experimental groups: A/B test.


2. User Retention Analysis

Objective: Measure how long users stay engaged with the product and identify factors leading to churn.

Use Cases:
	- Illustrate the probability of users staying active over time: Kaplan-Meier Estimator.
	- Segment users based on acquisition time and compare their retention rates: cohort analysis.
	- Predict which users are likely to churn: churn prediction models (Random Forest, XGBoost,etc).
	- Forecast future retention trends: time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet).
	- Segment users into high-value, dormant, and churned users: RFM model.

3. User Behavior Analysis

Objective: Understand user interactions within the product to improve engagement and conversion rates.

Use Cases:
	- Visualize user navigation paths and key drop-off points: Sankey Diagram
    - Analyze user transition probabilities between different product states： Markov Chain Model (e.g., install -> open -> input -> switch).
	- Detect user state transitions: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (e.g., active → dormant → churn).
    - Identify causal relationships between user behaviors: Bayesian Networks: .
	- Discover behavior patterns: Association Rule Mining (Apriori, FP-Growth) (e.g., “Users who used A service are likely to use B service.”)
	- Identify areas where users interact most on a page for UI/UX optimization: Heatmap Analysis.



Survival Analysis

Objective: Measure overall customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

Use Cases:
- Measures likelihood of recommending the product: Net Promoter Score (NPS).
- Evaluates how satisfied customers are with a specific interaction: Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
- Assesses the ease of using a product or service: Customer Effort Score (CES)
- Analyze customer feedback to understand their sentiment and identify areas for improvement: Sentiment Analysis
- Understand which product features users value most: Product Feature Value Analysis.
- Find relationships between categorical survey responses: Chi-Square Test.
- Identify relationships between variables: Correlation Analysis (Pearson/Spearman)
- Compare means across groups: ANOVA/T-Test
